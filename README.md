This is a web application written in Python and powered by Streamlit.

It features a snowfall effect using emoji snowflakes, personalizes the greeting by fetching the user's name from 
the URL parameters, and showcases a festive Lottie animation. Additionally, it applies custom CSS to enhance the 
app's visual appeal. Users can personalize their experience by adding their name to the query parameters in 
the URL. To access this web application, visit (https://merrychristmas.streamlit.app/?name=YourName) and replace `YourName` in the URL with your name.
