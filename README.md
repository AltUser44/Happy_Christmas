This is a web application written in Python and powered by Streamlit.

It features a snowfall effect using emoji snowflakes, personalizes the greeting by fetching the user's name from 
the URL parameters, and showcases a festive Lottie animation. Additionally, it applies custom CSS to enhance the 
app's visual appeal. Users can personalize their experience by adding their name to the query parameters in 
the URL.
